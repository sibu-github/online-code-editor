# Collaborative project on GitHub

The application we are going to build is an online code sharing platform with online code editor and online code compiler.

## Features
Following are the features of the application.

- [ ] User sign up into the application.
- [ ] User login to the application.
- [ ] Captcha checking before login.
- [ ] Create a new online code editor.
- [ ] Option to choose different theme, font size and font family inside the code editor.
- [ ] Option to write code in 5 different programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python, Javascript)
- [ ] Option to compile code and run online.
- [ ] Option save code for future. 
- [ ] Option to share code with others. (Others should not required to be logged in to view shared code)
- [ ] Option to write and share code annonymously without login. 
- [ ] When running code annonymously there should be captcha checking to prevent bots. 
> ###### Future enhancements
> - Ability to collaborate with other with live code editor. 
> - Formatting of the code using standard formatter
> - Integration with LSP to provide auto completion and linting.


## Roadmap
Following are the plans and roadmap for this application development.

##### Stage 1
Everyone research on their own and submit a design proposal by `12-Sep-2023`. By `15-Sep-2023` all design proposals will be reviewed and combined into creating a final design proposal. A design proposal should includes below points - 
- What framework to use for building frontend?
- What are the libraries needed for different parts of the application? (Ex: code editor, captcha etc.)
- What technology to use for backend?
- What are the library to use for backned?
- How to make the application secure?
- How to make the application scalable?
- How to make the application robust?

> ***Design Constraints: No paid resources can be used. All external libraries/APIs used must be free of cost.***

##### Stage 2
Post finalization of design we will proceed with development of the application. As per the final design, tasks will be broken down and distributed among ourselves. Everyone need to implement their part and test properly. Unit test is a must. Everyone need to submit their final code by `29-Sep-2023`. 

##### Stage 3
Post `29th` code will be cross assigned for peer review and betterment. Suppose person A implements a module. Then that module will be assigned to Person B now. Any improvement to the code done by person B has to be reviewed and approved by person A. Final code collection by `6-Oct-2023`. 

##### Stage 4
Combine everyone's module and start the end to end testing. Finish E2E by `13-Oct-2023`. 

##### Stage 5
Launch the final website.
